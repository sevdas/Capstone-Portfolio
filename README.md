# Portfolio Single-Page Application

This is a single-page portfolio application containing the following sections:

- A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
- A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
- A section to display your featured projects as cards in a grid fashion
- A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact you
- Header with show/hide animation depending on the scroll direction.

It uses some popular open-source libraries to help it have a more polished and professional-looking page.
